# Network environment requirements for live streaming and viewing

- ### I want to share my live streaming with people at home, and we use the same home network.

    - **Please check if your home network meets the network requirements**

    - The viewing device needs to use a WiFi 5 5G connection. (Viewing at home will not use the external network)
    - The computer for live streaming needs to use a wired network, not WiFi

- ### I want to share my live streaming with friends, and we use different networks.

    - **Your friends need to use a WiFi 5 5G connection**

    - If your friend is using a 4G connection, the live stream can be viewed, but may experience problems with connection. Please refer to our **[`FAQ`](/docs/FAQ.md)**



- ### **Recommended network plan for streamers:**  
    - **Please use a wired network for streaming. WiFi is not recommended**
