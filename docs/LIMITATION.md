# Limitations

### GPU Limitations
- **We only support NVIDIA graphics cards**
- If the computer is running other applications that use up GPU resources, the streamer may experience live streaming problems
- If you experience problems, check for error messages in your Beat Saber folder:
  - Navigate to the path /Logs/_latest.txt
  - If you see `streaming session error`, your GPU may be occupied by other apps
  - Close other apps or try restarting your computer

### Browser VR Mode Streaming Support
- **Viewing VR 3D streaming is only supported by the latest Google Chrome version**
- The first time you enter VR mode in Chrome using the WebXR API Emulator extension, your SteamVR status will change from <br>`SteamVR Home` -> `Chrome 106`,  indicating you have successfully entered VR mode
- If you try to re-enter VR mode in Chrome but are unable to, and `Chrome 106` doesn't appear as your SteamVR status, this may be due to a bug in the extension. Follow these steps:
  - Refresh your live stream browser 
  - Restart your SteamVR
  - Enter VR mode again (the SteamVR status should show as `Chrome 106`)
 > In "Chrome XXX" XXX is your Chrome version
