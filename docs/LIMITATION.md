### Viewer limitation
 Resolution | Limit viewers 
 ----- | ----- 
| 3840Ã—2160 (4K) |  16 viewers
| 2560x1440 (2K) |   20 viewers
| 1920x1080 (1080P)| 40 viewers

> 2D & 3D cameras have same limitation  
> 
> Example: 
> - streamer builds 3 source cameras with resolutions of 3D/2K, 2D/2K, and 2D/1080P
> - then build 3 viewers in scene setting and link with 3 source cameras 
> - start streaming in BeatSaber and share link will get 3 share urls
> - each URL has an individual audience limit
> - So 3D/2K has 20 viewers limit
> - 2D/2K has 20 viewers limit
> - 2D/1080P has 40 viewers limit
